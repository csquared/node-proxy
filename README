==== Proxy Server(s) w. Node.js ====

This project aims to provide simple yet scalable
implementations of Proxy Servers using Node.js and
JS.Class in a TDD paradigm.

Right now there is only one proxy, the Duplicating
Proxy Server

 ============   The Duplicating Proxy Server ================

   Node.js makes event-driven server-side javascript FAST and 
 simple - to a point.  The event-driven paradigm is tough to
 grok when you come from a procedural world.  JS.Class lets
 me write javascript like its Ruby.  And I love Ruby.

 The idea of the duplicating proxy is simple: 
  - listen for traffic on one port.
  - forward the traffic to two servers
  - reply with the response of one of the servers

 You can run this file like so:
   node dupProxy.js [proxy server] [responding server] [duplication server]
   
   A server is specified as either host:port or just port

   ex node dupProxy.js 8000 3000 jimsmachine.com:3500

   Would start the proxy on port 8000 on localhost.
    This will forward tcp traffic to port 3000 at the localhost and
    port 3500 at jimsmachine.com
